# Robocon_18

Robocon is Asia’s largest robotics competition.  The national round (whichserves  as  the  first  leg)  is  held  in  Pune  and  is  organized  by  DD  and  ABU.The  theme  of  ABU  Robocon  2018  is  based  on  an  interesting  Vietnamesefolk game called “Shuttlecock Throwing”, played by their locals during theirfestival  “N ́EM  C`ON”  -  The  Festival  Wishing  Happiness  and  Prosperity.Two  robots  had  to  be  built  for  this  competition  -  a  manual  and  an  au-tonomous robot.  The manual robot had to transfer the shuttlecocks to theAutonomous robot.  In turn, the autonomous robot had to shoot these shut-tlecocks through rings/hoops.  There were two rings (or three targets) on thefield.  The autonomous robot had to throw at least one shuttlecock throughthe first ring from two different positions.  After successfully completing this,the robot could throw a shuttlecock through the second ring and into a cupto win the game.  The robots had to follow a stringent set of rules regardingthe dimensions, weight and other aspects.  The winner of the national roundwas awarded the chance to represent India in the International Robocon heldin Vietnam.The  2018  Robocon  team  focused  on  the  development  of  more  refined  androbust systems than previous years for the different components and mech-anisms  used  in  the  robots.   Looking  at  the  problems  faced  by  past  teamsfrom  IITD,  the  team  managed  to  implement  several  new  design  strategiesand features for this year.The following document contains the chronological design process that Robo-con 2018 team followed to arrive at a complete system design.  The documentcovers the integration of the subsystems into a complete robot and the fab-rication  of  the  robots.   In  the  latter  sections,  testing  and  final  results  ofperformance of the two robots are presented.  This document fully chroniclesthe steps that were followed by the team from the initial group formation tothe final testing of the 2018 robots.
